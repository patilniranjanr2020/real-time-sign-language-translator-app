#Abstract
 The Real-Time Sign Language Translator App aims to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language and non-sign language users. The app utilizes a smartphone camera to capture gestures in real time, translating them into text or speech. It supports multiple sign languages like ASL, BSL, and Indian Sign Language. Additional features include speech-to-sign conversion, multilingual translation, offline support, and custom gesture mapping for personalized communication. The app is developed using Kotlin, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and TensorFlow Lite for gesture recognition. Firebase handles authentication and realtime data, while NLP and text-to-speech APIs enhance multilingual capabilities. The app ensures inclusivity with features like offline translation for poor connectivity areas and real-time integration for video calls. Designed for accessibility, this app provides a user-friendly solution for hearing or speech-impaired individuals, offering practical use in education, healthcare, and personal communication
